# AI Deep Learning Web Site

Organization's web site deployed using GitHub Pages.

## What has been done

* Created an AWS account
* Created an AWS organization
* Granted access to Giri
* Initial basic set up of SageMaker
* Created GitHub organization
* Configured organization's domain and initial web site - https://ai-deep-learning.us/
* Researched AWS instance types for deep learning, P4 are fastests and most economical, but most expensive per hour at the same time - $30/hour
* Requested access to SageMaker Studio Labs

## Next steps

* Set up local environment for StarCoder - https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/tree/main
* Figure out the best way to run StarCoder on AWS (EC2, ECS, spot instances?), implement, document
